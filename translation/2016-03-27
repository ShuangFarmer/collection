## The doll's house
> When dear old Mrs. Hay went back to town after staying with the Burnells she sent the children a doll's house. It was so big that the carter and Pat carried it into the courtyard, and there it stayed, propped up on two wooden boxes beside the feed-room door. No harm could come to it; it was summer. And perhaps the smell
of paint would have gone off by the time it had to be taken in. For, really, the smell of paint coming from that doll's house('Sweet of old Mrs. Hay, of course; most sweet and generous!')-but
the smell of paint was quite enough to make any one seriously ill, in Aunt Beryl's opinion. Even before the sacking was taken off. And when it was.

亲爱的Hay夫人在burnell家借住了一段时日，临走前，她送给burnell家孩子们一个玩具屋。玩具屋体型庞大，需马车夫和pat两人齐力才能搬进院子
